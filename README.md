**Variables** \
Template variables are defined by the context dictionary passed to the template.

You can mess around with the variables in templates provided they are passed in by the application. Variables may have attributes or elements on them you can access too. What attributes a variable has depends heavily on the application providing that variable.


**{% ... %} for Statements**\
A control structure refers to all those things that control the flow of a program - conditionals (i.e. if/elif/else), for-loops, as well as things like macros and blocks. With the default syntax, control structures appear inside {% ... %} blocks.



**{{ ... }} for Expressions to print to the template output**\
Jinja allows basic expressions everywhere. These work very similarly to regular Python; even if youâ€™re not working with Python you should feel comfortable with it.

**{# ... #} for Comments not included in the template output** \
